## Instructions on how to use

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. The current features are as a result of javascripting and a little bit of html and css tweaking.
The navigation bar has a list of sections and on clicking on the desired section,
the page is scrolled smoothly to the required section. 

## Features
- The nav section is highlighted when it is in the viewport.
- A scroll-up button is present at the base for smooth aided scrolling back to the top.
- The color of the button changes upon hovering over it to assure you it is clickable.

## Footer

The Udacity print is present at the footer along with the developer's instagram name.
